description: Governs how Claude plans, branches, implements, and tracks progress on the Mocap Studio project (multi-camera markerless motion capture → Blender pipeline, stages P1 Setup to P5 Blender) and any work organized as initiatives/epics/tasks under the initiatives/ folder. Use this whenever the user is doing Mocap Studio planning or implementation work — creating or scoping initiatives, epics, or tasks; starting or naming a git branch; implementing a single task file; deciding what counts as done; or figuring out how to hand off work between sessions. Also trigger this when the user mentions "initiative", "epic", "task file", "contract" (in the interface/schema/file-format sense, e.g. session.json or mocap_data.json), or references branches named fixes/.... This is a process skill, not a code-generation skill — consult it even for small asks like "start the next task" or "is this task done yet", not just big planning requests.

# Mocap Studio Workflow

This skill encodes how Rafael works on Mocap Studio: a strict initiative → epic → task planning hierarchy, a matching git branch hierarchy, a narrow implementation loop per task, and a small number of hard stop-and-flag rules. The point of all of this is that Rafael runs multiple parallel sessions on separate repo copies. A session that doesn't follow this structure produces work another session (or Rafael) can't safely pick up. When in doubt, favor smaller, more self-contained, more explicitly-flagged over bigger and smoother.

The pipeline itself is documented in `docs/diagrams/` (draw.io, stages P1–P5 and their numbered steps like `3.2 Body and hands`) and the open issues in `docs/review/`. Initiatives and epics should map onto those stages and steps where they can, so a task can be traced back to the box in the diagram it implements.

## Vocabulary

Don't use the word "Track" — it doesn't map to anything here. The real hierarchy is:

- **Initiative** — a top-level effort (e.g. `capture`, `face_pipeline`, `props`). Folder: `initiatives/<initiative>/`.
- **Epic** — a grouping of related tasks within an initiative (often one pipeline step, e.g. `sync_flash` for 2.1). Folder: `initiatives/<initiative>/epics/<epic>/`.
- **Task** — the atomic unit of work. One file, one session, one testable **contract**. File: `initiatives/<initiative>/epics/<epic>/tasks/<task>.md`.
- **Contract** — what a task delivers that other tasks or code will depend on: a function interface, a file format/schema (`config.yaml`, `session.json`, `calibration.toml`, `timestamps_[role].csv`, `props.yaml`, `mocap_data.json`), or a concrete update to a module. Smaller is better. The goal is that one file equals one incremental contract step — if a task's contract is ballooning to cover multiple deliverables, that's a signal to split it during planning, not to push through it.

## Branches

Every level of the planning hierarchy is its own branch. The hierarchy is carried
by **branch ancestry** — what each branch was created from — and never by slashes
in the name. Every branch name is a flat single token.

**One initiative chain per working copy.** Rafael runs parallel sessions on
separate repo clones; each clone carries exactly one active
`features → … → <task>` chain at a time, which is what makes the flat container
names (`features`, `epics`, `tasks`) unambiguous. Never build a second chain
alongside the first in the same clone. (Git also forbids it: a ref named
`tasks` and a ref named `tasks/anything` cannot coexist — which is the reason the
names are flat in the first place.)

| Level | Branch name | Created from | Corresponds to |
|---|---|---|---|
| container | `features` | `dev` | all feature work — integration point below `dev` |
| initiative | `<initiative>` (e.g. `capture`) | `features` | `initiatives/<initiative>/` |
| container | `epics` | `<initiative>` | the initiative's epics — integration point |
| epic | `<epic>` (e.g. `sync_flash`) | `epics` | `initiatives/<initiative>/epics/<epic>/` |
| container | `tasks` | `<epic>` | the epic's tasks — integration point |
| task | `<task>` (e.g. `3-esp32-led-firmware`) | `tasks` | `initiatives/<initiative>/epics/<epic>/tasks/<task>.md` — **the working branch; all task commits land here** |

Example chain (sync flash epic, task 3):
`dev → features → capture → epics → sync_flash → tasks → 3-esp32-led-firmware`

Create a parent before its child; don't create a level you won't use in this
clone. The branch you actually commit on is the leaf `<task>` branch — every
level above it is a pure integration point that only ever receives `--no-ff`
merges.

**Two long-lived branches:**
- `main` — release branch. Versions used for real capture sessions get cut from here. Treat it as something people outside this session depend on (an actor and a crew may be waiting on it).
- `dev` — development branch. "Not broken" means the full test suite passes — nothing more, nothing less. Half-finished work is fine to sit on `dev`; work that breaks a test is not.

**Fix branches** are the one exception to flat names: `fixes/<id>/<name_of_the_bug>`, where `<id>` is an incrementing hex counter starting at `000000` (go to `ffffff`, then widen to 7 hex digits if that's ever exhausted — there's no ticket tracker yet, so this counter is the only ID). The `fixes/` prefix is slash-namespaced precisely because a fix is *not* part of an initiative chain and never nests under one; correspondingly, never create a flat branch literally named `fixes`, `features`, `epics`, or `tasks` outside the scheme above. Fixes normally branch off `dev` and merge back into `dev`. A fix can branch off `main` instead when it's urgent enough to need a release-line patch (e.g. something blocking a scheduled capture session) — in that case merge it back to `main`, and also bring it into `dev` so the branches don't silently diverge (flag this to Rafael rather than assuming — confirm before merging a main-line fix back into dev if there's any conflict risk).

**Merge direction:** `<task> → tasks → <epic> → epics → <initiative> → features → dev → main`, every hop a `--no-ff` merge. A level only merges up once its own DoD is satisfied:

- **`<task>`** — its contract is delivered and the full test suite passes.
- **`tasks`** — every task branch scoped to the epic has merged into it.
- **`<epic>`** — `tasks` has merged in and the epic's acceptance gate, if it has one, passes (e.g. a recorded test take processes end to end through that step).
- **`epics`** — every epic branch of the initiative has merged into it.
- **`<initiative>`** — `epics` has merged in and the initiative's cross-epic gates pass.
- **`features`** — every active initiative has merged in.
- **`dev` → `main`** — an actual release. Rafael's call only, never automatic after a level lands.

**Who merges:** perform the merge locally once a level is done — don't wait for a PR or for Rafael to do it, and don't open PRs (there's no PR workflow here). Just merge, then report what happened.

**Commits:** one commit per logical change, conventional-commit style.

## Planning phase

Planning happens before any implementation, and it is not optional busywork — it's where dependencies, contracts, and pre-work get made explicit so a task can actually be picked up cold by another session.

A task is only ready to implement when:
1. Its **contract** is written down: what goes in, what's required, what it delivers. For pipeline steps, that is the step's `▶ In` / `◀ Out` from the diagram, made precise (fields, units, coordinate system, frame rate, file naming).
2. Its **dependencies** are written down explicitly in the task file — other tasks, Python packages and the venv they live in, external repos/models, and hardware. A task with no declared dependencies is assumed self-contained against whatever code already exists — if it turns out to need something undeclared once implementation starts, that is not something to resolve quietly (see "Push back" below).
3. Its **pre-work** is done. Pre-work is anything that has to exist before implementation can start — dependencies installed, model files downloaded (e.g. `face_landmarker.task`, DeepFace weights), **test takes / sample videos / fixture JSON recorded and committed or referenced**, calibration boards printed. This all counts as planning, not implementation.

**If pre-work itself needs any code, needs a capture session with an actor, or would take longer than one session, it does not get absorbed into the task.** Stop, flag it to Rafael, and offer it as a new task to be scoped and created through this same process. Never fold "a little bit of setup code" or "a quick test recording" into a task's implementation just because it seemed small — that's exactly the kind of undocumented scope creep this structure exists to prevent.

**Don't let documentation sprawl.** If something isn't covered by an existing task, the answer is a new task file, not a growing paragraph bolted onto a README or a review doc. A giant markdown file that tries to hold everything eventually holds nothing anyone can find. Keep files scoped to exactly what their branch/folder name says they are. If a change alters the pipeline itself (a new step, a removed step, a changed input/output), update the matching box in `docs/diagrams/` in the same task.

## Implementing one task

Once a task file is ready and its branch exists, the loop is:

1. Read the task file.
2. Implement exactly what it asks.
3. Run the full test suite (not just new tests — regressions anywhere are still regressions).
4. Update docs pertinent to that task's contract, if the contract affects them (including the diagram box for that step).
5. Mark the task file itself as done.
6. Commit, merge upward per the branch rules above, report, and stop.

**Scope boundary:** touch only the code, assets, and docs pertinent to *this* task's contract without asking. Anything outside that — another task's contract, an epic's branch structure, a shared file format, hardware choices, unrelated files — needs Rafael's go-ahead first. This is the whole rule; if something falls outside the task file's stated contract, it's a stop-and-ask by definition, not a judgment call to make in the moment.

**Large binaries stay out of git.** Raw takes (`.mkv`), aligned videos, `.npy` arrays, model weights, and renders are referenced by path or fetched by a script — never committed directly. Small fixtures needed by tests are the exception and should be kept as small as possible.

## Push back

Push back — stop and bring options to Rafael instead of proceeding — in these cases:

- **During planning**, whenever a decision would otherwise get made implicitly. This is the standing Mocap Studio principle: anything that belongs in an explicit declaration — camera roles and serials in `config.yaml`, actor and character data in `session.json`, prop definitions in `props.yaml`, the fields/units/axes/FPS of `mocap_data.json` — must never be inferred by code or quietly decided while scoping a task.
- **An undeclared dependency surfaces mid-implementation** (a package that conflicts with another venv, a model that needs a GPU, a step that turns out to need a new camera or sensor). This is an implementation-time discovery, not a planning failure — flag it, propose options, and let Rafael decide how to handle it rather than patching around it.
- **Anything that would cause architectural divergence or compromise the pipeline's integrity**, even if it's technically what a task's wording could be read to ask for — e.g. silently changing a shared file contract that other stages read, editing the locked NLA base track instead of a correction track, or collecting/retaining actor face or biometric data beyond what the session's consent covers. These get refused or flagged, regardless of framing.
- **Scope creep past a feature's boundary** that would pull in architecture decisions the current initiative/epic wasn't scoped to make (choosing the capture OS, a retargeting tool, adding LiDAR/depth hardware, etc.).

When in doubt about whether something is small enough to just do, it isn't — bring it up.

## Tracking progress

**Commits are the only source of truth.** There is no separate progress log and no checkbox system that stands on its own.

- If work is partial and uncommitted, it doesn't exist for the next session. That's expected and fine — a cold-start session picking up mid-work is supposed to look at git history and the working tree, deliberate, and decide how to continue. Don't try to leave hints outside of commits for a future session to find.
- If work *is* committed, the commit must be accompanied by the task file being marked done. A commit without that marker is a red flag — surface it rather than assuming it means the task is finished or safe to build on.

So in practice: don't mark a task file done without a corresponding commit, and don't leave a commit for a completed task without updating the task file. The two travel together.
